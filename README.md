Fourth assignment on creating a crystal collector game using JQuery along with Javascript.

Tools/Languages used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery

Instructions:

A target number will be given at the beginning of the game.  There are four crystals below: ruby, topaz, emerald and sapphire.  When the crystal is clicked, you will receive a certain amount of points added to your total score.  Each crystal will have a different value depending which one you'll click on.   If you match the total amount of points listed on a target number, you win the game.   If your score exceeds up to any target number, you lose the game. Good luck and have fun!
